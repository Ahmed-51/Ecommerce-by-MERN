# EcommercebyMERN

I have created an **E-commerce Website** using **MERN Stack**, which includes MongoDB, the Express.JS framework, the React.JS library, and the Node.JS platform. This application is fully functional with **different views for users and administrators**, and it also has an **integrated payment gateway** for checkout. By using this website, you can buy various types of products based on your interests.


Initially, when we run the website, we are placed to Home Page. We have access to Cart Page and Sign In page. We can Sign In by proceeding to the page, also we can register by clicking “register” and it will take us to Sign Up Page. Once we are registered, our info will be saved to the database and will get a personal account in the website. After sign In or Sign Up, the page will redirect to the home page.


From home page, we can search or browse for our desired products. We can see their detailed description by going to Product Description Page and also can add a Review there. We can see other users review and make a decision about the product. We can see the availability status of the product and the product into cart. Then we can go to Cart Page and proceed to checkout. It will take us to Shipping Address Page and then Payment Method Page and then Place Order Page and finally Order details Page. Thus ensuring an order.

After a user sign in, he can go to Profile Page and update info and also can se his all orders. After an admin signs in, he can do CRUD operation on users, orders and products by proceeding to respective pages. Admin can go to Orders Page and see all the orders created by all users and also check their details which shows whether the money is paid or not and also whether the order has been delivered or not. 

Admin can go to Users List Page and edit their info and make any user a co-admin. Admin can go to Product List Page and see all the details, edit, update and delete them. Admin can also craete new products as well by going to Create Product Page. Again he can go to his Profile Page and update info and also can se his all orders if any.

Any user or admin wishing to Log Out can easily click “Log out” button placed at the header and he will be signed out and his user info will be removed from localstorage but it will still be in database and we can use that information to identity verification if he wishes to sign in again into his account
